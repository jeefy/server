# NVIDIA sysexts

Use this skill when working on the NVIDIA driver and toolkit sysexts shipped
as opt-in overlays for Bluefin Server. How extensions load, merge and reach
nodes, these two included, is canonical in
[systemd-sysext-extensions.md](systemd-sysext-extensions.md); this skill covers
what is specific to NVIDIA: flavours, bumps, and container runtimes.

## When to Use

- Bumping an NVIDIA driver flavour (`include/nvidia.yml`) or the NVIDIA
  Container Toolkit (`include/nvidia-container-toolkit.yml`).
- Adding a driver flavour for a new NVIDIA branch (e.g. `nvidia-open-615`).
- Changing the shared recipe (`include/nvidia-driver.yml`), the units and
  drop-ins in `files/nvidia/sysext/`, or the toolkit's drop-in in
  `files/nvidia-container-toolkit/sysext/`.
- Changing the `nvidia-open-<branch>` sysupdate feature and transfer, or the
  `nvidia-container-toolkit` sysupdate component.
- Wiring containerd or the GPU Operator to a Bluefin GPU node.

## When NOT to Use

- Extension identity, merging, delivery, and the kernel-module loader
  `bluefin-sysext-modules`: [systemd-sysext-extensions.md](systemd-sysext-extensions.md).
- Sysupdate features, components and signing:
  [systemd-sysupdate-verification.md](systemd-sysupdate-verification.md).
- Choosing sysexts per node with Booty: [booty-integration.md](booty-integration.md).
- Other sysexts: [k0s-sysext.md](k0s-sysext.md), [kubeadm-sysext.md](kubeadm-sysext.md);
  ZFS and KubeStellar live in systemd-sysext-extensions.md.

## What ships

| Sysext | Release asset | Version | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Driver flavour | `nvidia-open-<branch>_<image-version>.raw.zst` | Locked to the image (`ID=bluefin-server`, `VERSION_ID=<image-version>`) | The open kernel modules (signed, zstd-compressed), the headless userspace, GSP firmware, NVIDIA's license, and the units and modprobe / sysusers / tmpfiles drop-ins every flavour shares. |
| Container Toolkit | `nvidia-container-toolkit-<ctk-ver>.raw.zst` | Own axis (`ID=_any`), like k0s | `nvidia-ctk`, `nvidia-cdi-hook`, `nvidia-container-runtime` (upstream's `.cdi` variant) and upstream's `nvidia-cdi-refresh.{service,path}`, with upstream's drop-in and a Bluefin one, plus a containerd drop-in for the `nvidia` runtime handler. CDI only: no OCI hook or `libnvidia-container`. |

Both are opt-in: nothing in the base image ships or enables them.

### Open kernel modules only (Turing and newer)

- Only `kernel-open/` is built (`make -C payload/kernel-open`), never the
  closed `kernel/` tree, so a flavour drives Turing and newer GPUs only. The
  modules are `nvidia nvidia-uvm nvidia-modeset nvidia-drm`; `nvidia-peermem`
  is left out, because it serves GPUDirect RDMA over InfiniBand, which the
  FSDK kernel lacks.
- The `.run` is never executed: the build unpacks its payload after the
  makeself prologue and checks that the payload's `.manifest` names the
  pinned version.
- The userspace is headless: the `nvidia-libs` and `nvidia-tools` lists in
  `include/nvidia-driver.yml`, and no 32-bit libraries, X driver,
  `nvidia-settings`, `libglvnd`, OpenCL ICD loader, NGX, OptiX, VDPAU, NvFBC,
  VulkanSC or `nvidia-powerd`. NVIDIA's binaries ship byte-for-byte
  (`strip-binaries` is empty). The install fails when a shipped ELF needs a
  library that neither the sysext nor `nvidia-external-needed` provides, so a
  library NVIDIA splits out in a later release breaks the build, not a node.

## Flavours

`include/nvidia.yml` is the only list of flavours. Each flavour is a comment
line and two atoms, so per-flavour pull requests never edit adjacent lines:

```yaml
variables:
  # nvidia-open-595: production branch 595
  nvidia-open-595-version: "595.104.02"
  nvidia-open-595-sha256: "e421c202e4c79f58c3c7f3161bbe71454ebb3d88936f88205a0e327cd04c59ca"
```

The version is NVIDIA's directory under
`https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/`, and the sha256 is that of
`NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-<version>.run`, as NVIDIA publishes it in
`<file>.sha256sum` next to the `.run`. The driver element's `ref:` reads the
sha256 atom, so a bump edits `include/nvidia.yml` only.

A node runs one flavour. When more than one `nvidia-open-*` extension is
merged, `nvidia-flavour-guard.service` fails and `nvidia-load.service`, which
requires it, loads nothing: every flavour installs the same module, binary
and library-link paths, so two merged flavours would shadow each other.
Booty refuses a second flavour per host up front. A flavour and the ZFS
sysext merge together (see the kernel-module sysexts in
systemd-sysext-extensions.md). Moving a node to a new branch means adding a
flavour, overlapping, then retiring the old one.

### Adding a flavour

Only add a branch NVIDIA publishes. Every flavour enlarges every release set
and image build; [ci-tooling.md](ci-tooling.md) has the cost of one.

1. `include/nvidia.yml`: a comment line and the two atoms
   `<flavour>-version` and `<flavour>-sha256`.
2. Copy `elements/nvidia/nvidia-open-595.bst`,
   `elements/nvidia/nvidia-open-595-signed.bst` and
   `elements/oci/nvidia-open-595-sysext.bst` to the new flavour's names and
   replace `nvidia-open-595` throughout: `nvidia-flavour`, `nvidia-version`,
   the `ref:` atom, the `sysext-*` variables, and the dependencies between
   the three.
3. `elements/oci/bluefin-server-image.bst`: stage `oci/<flavour>-sysext.bst`
   and add its `<flavour>_%{image-version}.raw.zst` to the signed set;
   `scripts/publish-release.sh`: expect the new asset.
4. `files/os/sysupdate.d/`: a `<flavour>.feature` and a
   `<NN>-<flavour>.transfer`, copied from `nvidia-open-595.feature` and
   `33-nvidia-open-595.transfer`.
5. `Justfile`: add `oci/<flavour>-sysext.bst` to the graph `just validate`
   resolves. `build-nvidia-sysext`, `export-nvidia-sysext` and
   `dogfood-nvidia` take the flavour as their argument.
6. `.github/scripts/track-binaries.py`: register
   `NvidiaDriverComponent("<flavour>")` in `COMPONENTS`.
7. `tests/unit/test_nvidia_sysext.py`: update the flavour list that
   `test_flavour_table_matches_the_element_files` pins; the other tests there
   read `include/nvidia.yml` and run for every flavour.

Booty accepts any `nvidia-open-<branch>`, so nothing changes there. A missed
step fails `tests/unit/test_nvidia_sysext.py` (elements, signed release set,
`publish-release.sh`, feature and transfer, Justfile) or
`tests/unit/test_track_binaries.py` (every flavour tracked).

## Bumping

### Driver

`.github/workflows/track-binaries.yml` runs `.github/scripts/track-binaries.py`
daily ([ci-tooling.md](ci-tooling.md)). For each flavour it reads NVIDIA's
directory index; a newer release of the flavour's branch counts once its
`.run` and `.run.sha256sum` are both there, and `check` never downloads a
`.run`. It then opens one pull request per flavour that moves both atoms,
with the sha256 read from NVIDIA's `.run.sha256sum` and confirmed against the
downloaded `.run`. To move to a given release of the branch by hand, with the
same verification:

```bash
python3 .github/scripts/track-binaries.py apply nvidia-open-595 --version 595.<x>.<y>
```

The tracker refuses a version outside the flavour's branch: a new branch is a
new flavour.

### Container Toolkit

The element fetches the release tag with git (`git_repo`) and builds from
the vendored modules upstream commits. Its `ref:` reads the two atoms in
`include/nvidia-container-toolkit.yml`: the version and the commit the tag
points to. NVIDIA publishes no checksum for any archive of the source, so
the tracker pins the commit instead, and writes it only when the GitHub API
and the git remote (`git ls-remote`) name the same commit for the tag.

The same tracker run proposes patch releases of the pinned `MAJOR.MINOR`
(stable GitHub releases only). A minor bump runs the same verification:

```bash
python3 .github/scripts/track-binaries.py apply nvidia-container-toolkit --version <x>.<y>.<z>
```

Before merging any bump, compare upstream's `deployments/systemd/` units for
the new release with
`files/nvidia-container-toolkit/sysext/nvidia-cdi-refresh-bluefin.conf`,
which replaces upstream's `ExecCondition=`.

## GPU nodes

### Choosing the sysexts

- Installed node: enable the `nvidia-open-<branch>` sysupdate feature
  ([systemd-sysupdate-verification.md](systemd-sysupdate-verification.md)) and
  `nvidia-container-toolkit-activate.service` (systemd-sysext-extensions.md).
- Booty: list `nvidia-open-<branch>` and `nvidia-container-toolkit` in the
  host's `extensions` ([booty-integration.md](booty-integration.md)).

A node without an NVIDIA GPU can merge both. `nvidia-load.service` skips
itself (its `ExecCondition=` finds no PCI display controller, class `0x03`,
from vendor `0x10de`), `nvidia-device-nodes.service` and
`nvidia-persistenced.service` then skip on their conditions, and the
toolkit's drop-in skips `nvidia-cdi-refresh.service` on the same PCI check.
`nvidia-ldconfig.service` and the flavour guard run on every node.

### nouveau and mixed-generation hosts

nouveau ships in the base image (not in the initrd), and udev binds it to
every NVIDIA GPU before systemd-sysext merges the driver sysext. The
sysext's `/usr/lib/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf` (`blacklist nouveau`, `options
nouveau modeset=0`) only covers loads after the merge, and the UKI is shared
by every node, so its command line cannot blacklist nouveau for GPU nodes
alone. nvidia refuses a GPU another driver holds (`NVRM: GPU 0000:01:00.0
is already bound to nouveau`, then `could not insert 'nvidia': No such
device`), and while nouveau holds the card a container's `ffmpeg` picks up
its userspace (`nouveau_drv_video.so`).

`nvidia-load.service` runs `/usr/libexec/nvidia-load`
(`files/nvidia/sysext/nvidia-load`), which: lists the NVIDIA display
controllers and, when nouveau holds any, runs `modprobe -r nouveau` (a
base-image module; nothing has opened `/dev/dri` this early), writing each
held address to `/sys/bus/pci/drivers/nouveau/unbind` when the module is in
use; loads `nvidia nvidia-uvm nvidia-modeset nvidia-drm` through
`bluefin-sysext-modules`; succeeds when `/proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/` lists at
least one GPU, warning about every NVIDIA GPU nvidia does not drive (the
open modules are Turing and newer only, so a Pascal card in a mixed box
stays unused while the supported one comes up); fails only when the loader
failed or no GPU came up. `tests/unit/nvidia-load_test.bats` runs it
against a fake `/sys` and `/proc/driver/nvidia/gpus`.

### Containers (CDI)

Once the toolkit is merged, and after `nvidia-ldconfig.service` and
`nvidia-device-nodes.service`, `nvidia-cdi-refresh.service` runs
`nvidia-ctk cdi generate`, which writes `/var/run/cdi/nvidia.yaml`.
containerd 2.x has CDI on by default and reads that directory, so a plain
pod that asks for a CDI device gets it from `runc`: the default runtime
stays `runc` and there is no OCI hook.

### The `nvidia` runtime handler

The toolkit also ships `/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime`, a symlink to
upstream's `nvidia-container-runtime.cdi` (`cmd/nvidia-container-runtime.cdi`:
the runtime wrapper with its mode fixed to `cdi` in code). It reads the
container's device requests (`NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all`, a fully qualified
`nvidia.com/gpu=...`, or CDI annotations), injects the matching devices from
`/etc/cdi` and `/var/run/cdi` into the OCI spec and execs `runc` from
`PATH`. Upstream's defaults already are `default-kind = "nvidia.com/gpu"`
and those spec directories, so no `/etc/nvidia-container-runtime/config.toml`
ships or is needed (one is honoured for `log-level`, `debug` and the like;
its `mode` is ignored). The plain `nvidia-container-runtime`, whose default
`mode = "auto"` resolves to the legacy stack (`nvidia-container-runtime-hook`
and `libnvidia-container`, neither of which ships), is not built.

For the kubeadm sysext the toolkit ships
`/usr/share/bluefin/containerd/conf.d/nvidia-container-runtime.toml`
(`files/nvidia-container-toolkit/sysext/containerd-nvidia-container-runtime.toml`),
which the kubeadm containerd config imports by glob
([kubeadm-sysext.md](kubeadm-sysext.md)): a `runtimes.nvidia` entry of type
`io.containerd.runc.v2` with `BinaryName = "/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime"`
and `SystemdCgroup = true`, and no `default_runtime_name`. A node without
the toolkit has no `nvidia` handler; a node with it serves
`RuntimeClass nvidia`. k0s's containerd reads `/etc/k0s/containerd.d/`
instead and is not wired up here.

containerd resolves `imports` once, at config load. A diskless node merges
the toolkit before containerd starts, but an installed node merges it later
(the activate unit waits for the network fetch) while containerd is already
up, so the glob would match nothing. `nvidia-container-toolkit-activate`
therefore runs `systemctl try-restart containerd.service` after the refresh;
containers survive it (`KillMode=process`). A node that rewrites
`/etc/containerd/config.toml` afterwards still restarts containerd itself.

`nvidia-container-runtime.cdi` honours `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` even for
unprivileged containers (upstream defaults
`accept-nvidia-visible-devices-envvar-when-unprivileged = true`), so with a
cluster-wide `RuntimeClass nvidia` any pod asking for that class and
`NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all` claims every GPU, bypassing device-plugin
accounting. The operands rely on it, so nothing here changes it; a cluster
can tighten it in `/etc/nvidia-container-runtime/config.toml` (plus policy on
the RuntimeClass) at the cost of operands that ask for devices by env var.

### GPU Operator

The driver and the CDI spec come from the sysexts, so the GPU Operator chart
installs neither:

```yaml
driver:
  enabled: false   # the driver sysext
toolkit:
  enabled: false   # the toolkit sysext and its CDI spec
cdi:
  enabled: true    # the chart's default since v25.10.0
```

That is `--set driver.enabled=false --set toolkit.enabled=false --set
cdi.enabled=true`. Time-slicing and MIG are GPU Operator settings
(`devicePlugin.config`, `mig.strategy`), not changes to the sysexts.

The operator schedules its own operands (device plugin, GPU feature
discovery, DCGM exporter, validator) with `runtimeClassName: nvidia`
(`operator.runtimeClass`) and `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all`, and creates the
`RuntimeClass` cluster-wide. Verified on a kubeadm node with the toolkit
sysext but no `nvidia` handler: every operand stays in `ContainerCreating`
with `FailedCreatePodSandBox ... unable to get OCI runtime for sandbox`, so
there is no device plugin, no `nvidia.com/gpu` resource and no CDI injection
for workloads, which then fail with `CUDA driver version is insufficient`.
The `nvidia` handler above is what lets those operands start: the runtime
injects the whole GPU set into them through CDI, and workloads keep getting
their GPUs from the device plugin's CDI requests under `runc`.

## Build and test

- Driver: `just build-nvidia-sysext [FLAVOUR]`, `just export-nvidia-sysext
  [FLAVOUR]` and the QEMU checks `just dogfood-nvidia [FLAVOUR]` and
  `DOGFOOD_SYSEXT=nvidia` / `zfs,nvidia` with `just dogfood-install`, all in
  [ddi-installer-build.md](ddi-installer-build.md). `FLAVOUR` defaults to
  `nvidia-open-595`.
- Toolkit: `just build-nvidia-container-toolkit-sysext`,
  `just export-nvidia-container-toolkit-sysext`.
- Both release assets are in the signed release set
  ([ddi-installer.md](ddi-installer.md)).
- Contracts: `tests/unit/test_nvidia_sysext.py` (driver),
  `tests/unit/nvidia-load_test.bats` (the load helper's nouveau eviction and
  mixed-host outcome),
  `tests/unit/test_nvidia_container_toolkit_sysext.py` (toolkit),
  `tests/unit/test_nvidia_container_toolkit_delivery.py` (toolkit activation
  and sysupdate), `tests/unit/test_track_binaries.py` (driver and toolkit tracking).
