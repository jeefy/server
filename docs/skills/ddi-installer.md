# Boot, Install, and Update Architecture

## When to Use

- Building or debugging the signed boot chain (UKIs, systemd-boot, Secure Boot key enrollment).
- Changing the diskless boot flow (`rd.systemd.pull`, dm-verity, initrd contents).
- Writing or refining `systemd-repart` recipes (`files/os/repart.d/`) or `systemd-sysupdate` transfers (`files/os/sysupdate.d/`).
- Working on the Ignition opt-in path (`elements/ignition/`, `files/initrd-ignition/`).

## When NOT to Use

- k0s or OpenZFS sysext work (see `k0s-sysext.md`, `systemd-sysext-extensions.md`).
- Release signing and sysupdate verification keys (see `systemd-sysupdate-verification.md`).

## One build, one version, one release set

`oci/bluefin-server-image.bst` produces every release artifact for one
`image-version` (`include/image.yml`, set per build by `just set-version`,
`YYYYMMDD.<run>` on main, `0.<run>` on PRs, at most 17 characters so it fits a
GPT partition label with room to spare):

| Artifact | Role |
|---|---|
| `bluefin-server_<ver>.raw` | OS DDI: `/usr` erofs partition, its dm-verity hash partition, and an ESP carrying the disk UKI plus the install-time `repart.d`. Diskless nodes pull it into RAM; booted diskless it is also the installer payload. |
| `bluefin-server_<ver>_<uuid>.usr.raw` / `...usr-verity.raw` | `systemd-sysupdate` sources for the usr and verity slots; the `<uuid>` in the name is the partition UUID derived from the usrhash. |
| `bluefin-server-<ver>.efi` | Disk UKI (installed nodes); also the sysupdate source for `$BOOT`. |
| `bluefin-server-netboot_<ver>.efi` | Netboot UKI (diskless nodes); the UEFI HTTP boot / PXE target. |
| `bluefin-server-netboot_<ver>.esp.raw` | Netboot ESP image: signed systemd-boot, the netboot UKI, and Secure Boot key enrollment payloads. Write it to a USB stick to boot diskless without HTTP boot. |
| `efi-keys/` | PK/KEK/db enrollment payloads. |
| `SHA256SUMS` | Checksums for everything above. |

The /usr image itself is built by `oci/bluefin-server-usr.bst` with an offline
`systemd-repart`: an erofs partition (`bluefin_usr_<ver>`) plus its dm-verity
hash partition (`bluefin_usr_verity_<ver>`), and the root hash is recorded in
`bluefin-server_<ver>.usrhash`. `/etc` is empty on every boot; its defaults
live in `/usr/share/factory/etc` and are copied in by `systemd-tmpfiles`.

## The boot chain

Both UKIs are built by `oci/bluefin-server-boot.bst` from the FSDK kernel
(`bluefin-server/kernel-modules.bst`, modules signed with our module key) and a
systemd-native initrd (no dracut; `bluefin-server/initrd/initrd-stack.bst`).
Both pin `usrhash=` of the same /usr image on their command lines and are
signed with DB, so Secure Boot locks those command lines. `lockdown=integrity`
is always on. `os-sd-boot-signed.bst` signs systemd-boot with the same DB key
so installed disks and the netboot ESP get a loader firmware accepts.

Dev keys come from `just gen-dev-keys` (throwaway keys in the gitignored
`files/boot-keys/`); CI builds on main use the `BOOT_KEYS_TARBALL` secret.

### Diskless (netboot UKI)

```text
firmware -> signed systemd-boot -> bluefin-server-netboot_<ver>.efi
  -> initrd: network up (DHCP), systemd-importd pulls
     bluefin-server_<ver>.raw into RAM (rd.systemd.pull ... blockdev:rootdisk)
  -> systemd-veritysetup opens /usr from the loop partitions, checked against usrhash=
  -> switch root: tmpfs /, read-only erofs /usr
```

The pull source is the UEFI HTTP boot origin (`bootorigin:`) or the
`import.pull` system credential (SMBIOS type 11, QEMU fw_cfg, or ESP
`/loader/credentials`). The pull runs with `verify=no`; integrity is still
enforced end to end because the signed UKI pins `usrhash=` and dm-verity
checks every `/usr` block against it. A failed boot never drops to an
emergency shell: the initrd prints the errors and reboots
(`files/initrd/usr/lib/systemd/system/emergency.service.d/10-reboot.conf`),
which is what lets boot counting work unattended.

### Installed disk (disk UKI)

```text
firmware -> systemd-boot -> bluefin-server-<ver>.efi
  -> /usr slot found by partition label (bluefin_usr_<ver>) and the
     verity-derived UUIDs baked into the install-time repart.d
  -> persistent xfs root found by systemd gpt-auto discovery
```

Boot entries are counted (`bluefin-server-<ver>+3-0.efi`): after three failed
boots of a new image systemd-boot falls back to the previous UKI. That is the
automatic rollback path.

## Installing to disk

A running diskless node is the installer. The OS DDI's ESP partition is
mounted at `/run/bluefin/boot` (`run-bluefin-boot.mount`), which carries
`bluefin/repart.d`: the disk layout from `files/os/repart.d/` (ESP, usr slot A
+ verity copied from the running image, empty slot B, persistent xfs root)
with slot A's UUIDs pinned to the usrhash derivation by
`bluefin-server-boot.bst`.

```bash
systemctl start run-bluefin-boot.mount
systemd-sysinstall --definitions=/run/bluefin/boot/bluefin/repart.d /dev/sdX
```

`systemd-sysinstall` writes the ESP and slot A and links the disk UKI; the
first boot of the installed disk runs the initrd's `systemd-repart` (reading
`/sysusr/usr/lib/repart.d`) to create slot B and the persistent root. There is
no separate installer image, no shell installer, no offline media.

## Updates

Installed nodes update with `systemd-sysupdate` against the transfers in
`files/os/sysupdate.d/`:

- `10-usr.transfer` and `11-usr-verity.transfer` fill the inactive usr /
  usr-verity slot (matched by `bluefin_usr_@v` partition labels).
- `20-uki.transfer` installs the new disk UKI into `/EFI/Linux` with boot
  counting (`TriesLeft=3`, at most 2 UKIs kept).

Sources are the release assets on GitHub Releases, verified against the
GPG-signed `SHA256SUMS` (see `systemd-sysupdate-verification.md`). After an
update the node reboots into slot B; if the new image fails its three tries,
systemd-boot rolls back to slot A on its own. A Kured hook
(`files/os/systemd/systemd-sysupdate.service.d/kured-hook.conf`) touches
`/run/reboot-required` for cluster-aware reboot coordination.

Diskless nodes have no slots, so `systemd-sysupdate.service` is disabled when
booted diskless
(`files/os/systemd/system/systemd-sysupdate.service.d/10-diskless.conf`).
A diskless node updates by rebooting into a newer image; that is the whole
mechanism.

## Ignition (opt-in)

Ignition (v2.27.0, built from source in `elements/ignition/`) runs in the
initrd, adapted from the upstream dracut units into
`files/initrd-ignition/`. Because the kernel command line is locked inside the
signed UKI, the `ignition.config.url=` karg cannot be used; configs arrive as
**system credentials**:

- `ignition.config` — an inline Ignition JSON (or Butane YAML) config.
- `ignition.config.url` — a URL; wrapped into a `config.replace` stub and
  fetched once the network is online.

`bluefin-ignition-credentials` stages whichever is set into
`/run/ignition/user.ign`; every Ignition unit is conditioned on those
credentials, so a node booted without them runs none of it. Ignition runs on
**every** boot (there is no first-boot marker on a tmpfs root), so configs
must be idempotent. See `tests/fixtures/ignition/var-on-disk.ign` for a
dogfood-tested example (persistent /var on a second disk plus an SSH key).

## PXE / HTTP boot service

The intended network boot server is [Booty](https://github.com/jeefy/booty):
hand it the netboot UKI plus an `import.pull` credential (or serve the UKI as
the UEFI HTTP boot origin) and optionally an `ignition.config.url` credential
per node. Without Booty, writing `bluefin-server-netboot_<ver>.esp.raw` to a
USB stick boots a node diskless the same way.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "A bash script installer is simpler." | Installation stays `systemd-sysinstall`-native; the diskless boot already carries everything it needs. No shell installers. |
| "Hardcode `root=/dev/vda2` for QEMU." | Bare metal has different device names. Boot and root selection uses discoverable partition labels and verity-derived UUIDs. |
| "Kernel image is at `/boot/vmlinuz`." | FSDK installs kernels into `/usr/lib/modules/<kver>/vmlinuz`; `bluefin-server-boot.bst` picks it up from there for ukify. |
| "The initrd needs dracut." | The initrd is a hand-assembled systemd userspace (`initrd-stack.bst`) packed as newc cpio + zstd. No dracut anywhere in the tree. |
| "`verify=no` means the download is untrusted." | The signed UKI pins `usrhash=`; dm-verity verifies every `/usr` block read from the pulled image. Transport tampering can only cause a failed boot, which reboots. |
| "Ignition needs a karg." | The cmdline is sealed in the signed UKI. Ignition configs arrive as `ignition.config` / `ignition.config.url` system credentials. |
| "Diskless nodes need sysupdate." | Diskless nodes update by rebooting into a newer image; sysupdate is disabled when booted diskless. |

## Verification

- [ ] `just validate` resolves the BuildStream graph without errors.
- [ ] `just dogfood-check` passes (diskless boot, Secure Boot, no failed units).
- [ ] `just dogfood-install NEXT=<dir>` passes (install, disk boot, A/B update).
- [ ] UKIs pin `usrhash=` and are signed with DB; `sbverify` passes in `bluefin-server-boot.bst`.
- [ ] No hardcoded device paths in any boot configuration.
- [ ] No element named `bluefin-server-ddi` or `bluefin-server-installer` exists; the OS DDI comes from `oci/bluefin-server-image.bst`.
